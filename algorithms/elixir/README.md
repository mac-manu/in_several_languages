1.-Recursion:
Elixir is built on the Erlang VM, which has excellent support for recursion. Recursive functions are often used to perform operations on data structures such as lists and trees.

2.-Enum and Stream:
Elixir provides Enum and Stream modules that allow developers to perform functional operations on lists and other enumerable data structures. These modules provide a wide range of functions for working with data, such as map, filter, reduce, and more.

3.-Concurrency and parallelism:
Elixir provides lightweight processes that enable developers to easily create concurrent and parallel systems. The Task module allows you to run multiple processes concurrently and the Agent module allows you to share state across multiple processes.

4.-Pattern matching:
Elixir has a powerful pattern matching feature that allows you to easily destructure complex data structures and perform different actions based on the shape of the data.

5.-Pipe operator:
The pipe operator |> is an Elixir's built-in operator that allows you to chain function calls together in a more readable way. This is a powerful feature that can help you write more readable and maintainable code.

6.-ETS(Erlang Term Storage) and DETS(Disk-based Erlang Term Storage):
ETS and DETS are built-in database in Erlang, ETS is in-memory database and DETS is on-disk database. Both can be used to store and retrieve data efficiently, and are commonly used in Elixir projects.
